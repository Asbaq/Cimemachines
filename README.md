Cinemachine is a powerful **camera system for Unity** that enables dynamic and procedural camera behaviors. It simplifies camera control by allowing developers to set up complex camera movements, transitions, and tracking without writing extensive code. Cinemachine is widely used for creating **cinematic shots**, **gameplay cameras**, and **cutscenes** in Unity.

## 🎥 Key Features

✅ **Virtual Cameras:** Define multiple cameras with unique settings and blend between them.  
✅ **Camera Blending & Transitions:** Smoothly transition between different cameras.  
✅ **Target Tracking:** Automatically follow and frame the subject with smart tracking.  
✅ **Damping & Smoothing:** Achieve natural camera movements with customizable damping.  
✅ **Cinemachine Brain:** Manages camera blending and priorities at runtime.  
✅ **Impulse System:** Simulate realistic camera shakes for dynamic effects.  
✅ **Confiner & Collider Support:** Keep the camera within predefined boundaries.  
✅ **Freelook & POV Cameras:** Implement first-person, third-person, and orbit cameras.

## 🎮 How Cinemachine Works

### 🖼️ Virtual Camera System
- **Cinemachine Virtual Camera** acts as a director's shot, defining how the camera moves and frames the subject.
- Multiple **Virtual Cameras** can be used in a scene, and Cinemachine **blends** between them dynamically.

### 🎬 Camera Blending & Priorities
- Virtual cameras use a **priority system** to determine which camera is active.
- The **Cinemachine Brain** component blends between different cameras based on priority.
- Blending modes include **Cut, Ease In/Out, Linear, and Custom Curves**.

### 🎯 Target Tracking & Framing
- Virtual cameras can follow and adjust framing dynamically based on the target's movement.
- Developers can define **LookAt** and **Follow** targets to control the camera focus.
- The **Framing Transposer** allows smooth automatic repositioning around the target.

### 🎥 Cinemachine Camera Types
- **Freelook Camera:** Third-person orbiting camera for character control.
- **POV Camera:** First-person style camera with player input.
- **Dolly Track Camera:** Follows a predefined path with smooth movement.
- **State-Driven Camera:** Automatically switches cameras based on animation states.

## 🛠️ Cinemachine Implementation in Unity

### 📌 Setting Up Cinemachine
1. **Install Cinemachine:** Go to **Window > Package Manager** and install Cinemachine.
2. **Add a Cinemachine Brain:** Attach the **CinemachineBrain** component to the **Main Camera**.
3. **Create a Virtual Camera:** Go to **GameObject > Cinemachine > Virtual Camera**.
4. **Assign a Target:** Set the **Follow** and **LookAt** properties in the Virtual Camera.
5. **Adjust Camera Settings:** Configure **Damping, Field of View, Lens Settings, and Composer**.
6. **Blend Between Cameras:** Use priority settings or animation-driven state changes.

### 🎮 Example: Third-Person Camera
```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using Cinemachine;

public class ThirdPersonCamera : MonoBehaviour {
    public CinemachineVirtualCamera virtualCamera;
    public Transform player;

    void Start() {
        virtualCamera.Follow = player;
        virtualCamera.LookAt = player;
    }
}
```
